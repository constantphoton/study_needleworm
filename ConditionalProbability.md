sensitivity : A kit can exclusively detect a person who has pathogen.
specificity : A kit can exclusively detect a person who doesn't have pathogen.

Say
1. Sensitivity : 99% = 0.99
2. Specificity : 98% = 0.98
3. 0.01%(this # is can be a variable) of a group of people have pathogen.
4. Problem : If a person tested positive, does he/she really have pathogen?

Solution

We can draw a square or a line, may be a cube for a certain problem, for each probability problem.
For this problem, we can draw a square, which has length 1 edges.

| 0.02 | 0.98 |
| --- | --- |
| 0.99 | 0.01 |

this square can be divided into 2 sections of 0.01%(=variable) and 0.99%(=1-variable).
each section stands for a group which really has pathogen(0.01)
another for don't have pathogen(0.99)

( 0.01/100 * 99/100 ) / (99.99/100*2/100 + 0.01/100 * 99/100)

=~0.0049
