sensitivity : A kit can exclusively detect a person who has pathogen.
specificity : A kit can exclusively detect a person who doesn't have pathogen.

2. Specificity : 98% = 0.98
3. 0.01%(this # is can be a variable) of a group of people have pathogen.
4. Problem : If a person tested positive, does he/she really have pathogen?
